# Bash

The `.bashrc` file is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. It initializes an interactive shell session. You can put any command in that file that you could type at the **command prompt**.

You put commands here to set up the shell for use in your particular environment, or to customize things to your preferences. A common thing to put in `.bashrc` are aliases that you want to always be available.
